# Portfolio Website Design Guidelines

## Design Approach
**Reference-Based Approach** - Drawing inspiration from personal portfolio leaders like GitHub profiles, Notion personal pages, and developer portfolios. The site should feel personal yet professional, showcasing technical expertise with a human touch.

## Core Design Elements

### Color Palette
- **Dark Mode Primary**: Deep charcoal backgrounds (217 19% 12%) with bright text
- **Light Mode Primary**: Clean whites with dark text for contrast
- **Accent**: Subtle green (142 69% 58%) reflecting Linux/terminal aesthetics
- **Social Links**: Platform-specific colors when hovered

### Typography
- **Primary Font**: Inter or Fira Code for technical authenticity
- **Headings**: Bold weights (600-700) for clear hierarchy
- **Body**: Regular weight (400) with increased line height for readability
- **Code/Technical**: Monospace font for Gentoo Linux and technical mentions

### Layout System
**Tailwind Spacing**: Primary units of 4, 8, 16, and 24 for consistent rhythm
- Container max-width of 4xl (896px) for optimal reading
- Generous padding (p-8, p-16) for breathing room
- Consistent gap-8 between sections

### Component Library

#### Navigation
- Clean header with name/logo and minimal navigation
- Smooth scroll-to-section behavior
- Mobile-responsive hamburger menu

#### Hero Section

- Brief, engaging bio highlighting technical interests
- Subtle animation on scroll or load

#### About/Interests Section

- Social platform icons from established icon libraries

## Key Design Principles
1. **Technical Authenticity**: Reflect genuine technical interests
2. **Approachable Professionalism**: Friendly yet competent
3. **Performance-Focused**: Fast loading, minimal animations
